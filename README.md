# CITS4404-Project

## A Trading Bot Optimization Algorithm

1. **Dataset**: [BTC/USD Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/btcinusd)

2. **Background**:  
    After a nice conversation with gupta, I realized that many of you may not have a coding background and/or y'all are busy with other assignments. Therefore, I have tried to abstract this project as much as possible so that all you have to do now is implement a bot in the `bots/` folder. I have created an example bot, take a look at how its done and should be able to follow the same format. Of course, if someone could look over all my code and check against the project description that would be great.

    Everything below this is basically a draft for the report introduction.

3. **Documentation**:  
    - The ultimate goal of this project is to optimize hyperparameters using an algorithm. The number of hyperparameters may vary depending on the type of filters used (the type of filter itself may also be a hyperparameter).  
    - Datasets are located in the `data/` folder. You can choose which dataset to use. The datasets are separated into daily and hourly data, categorized as before 2020 and after 2020. Please use the datasets for before 2020 as specified in the project.

4. **Static Functions** (shouldn't need changes unless there is a logic issue):  
    - A function in `utils.data_loader` reads the CSV files. It accepts arguments to customize how the files are read. Refer to the documentation for details.
    - The `simulate_trades()` function in `trader.py` simulates trades based on the signals generated by your optimization algorithm. This evaluates the **fitness** of your bot. 
    - Basic filters are defined in `filters.wma`. Refer to the documentation for more information.
    - Run `leaderboards.py` when your bot is ready to compare with other bots. The function in `leaderboards.py` uses 2020 and 2021 data to evaluate the bots, DO NOT use these 2 datasets when training your bot (as per the project guidelines).

5. **Goal** i.e. tasks:
    - **Each group member**: implement 2 bots (should literally only take 1-2 hours)
        - 1 simple bot to get a feel for things: this can be an algorithm from lectures or any other algorithm you wish to implement.
        - 1 complex bot: ideally one of the nature-based algorithms researched in part 1.
    - Anyone that wishes to (may be necessary for completing your bot)
        - Implement some custom filters and MACD filters.
        - Use matplotlib to generate some plots with buy/sell signals marked for each bot
        - Start writing the report or draft of report

6. **How to Implement a Bot**:To implement a bot, follow these steps:
    1. **Create a New Python File**:
    - Add a new Python file in the `bots/` folder. For example, `my_bot.py`.

    2. **Write Two Functions**:
    - Every bot must have two functions:
        - `generate_signals(data)`: This function generates trading signals based on the input data.
        - An optimization function (e.g., `my_optimizer()`): This function optimizes the hyperparameters for the bot.
        - The bot is separated into 2 functions so that you can implement both in any way you like and select as many hyperparameters as you wish.

    3. **`generate_signals(data)` Function**:
    - This function **must**:
        - Take a single required argument, `data`, which is a pandas DataFrame containing the price data.
        - Return a NumPy array of the same length as the input data, containing:
        - `1` for buy signals,
        - `-1` for sell signals,
        - `0` for hold signals.
    - If hyperparameters are not provided, this function should call the optimizer to determine the best parameters.
        - To do this, set hyperparameters to default value of `None`.
        - `leaderboard.py` calls the `generate_signals()` function with no hyperparamaters provided so that it can be tested against the 2020 and 2021 datasets.
    - This function may vary from bot to bot, e.g. one bot may use an ema filter comined with an lma filter, whilst another bot may use the filter as a hyperparameter itself.
    - Regardles of how complex or exotic the bot is, the final goal of any bot is to generate buy/sell signals.

    4. **Optimization Function**:
    - The optimization function should:
        - Use the `simulate_trades()` function to evaluate the performance of candidate solutions.
        - Use the `generate_signals()` function to generate the signals used in `simulate_trades()`
        - Return the optimal hyperparameters for the bot.

    5. **Test Your Bot**:
    - Use `leaderboards.py` to test your bot against the 2020 and 2021 datasets.
    - Alternatively, use `test.py` to test your bot independently.

    6. **Naming Convention**:
    - Ensure your bot file has a unique name (e.g., `my_bot.py`).
    - The `generate_signals()` function must be present in every bot file and follow the required signature.

7. **Algorithms to Implement** (choose from these if you wish):
    - CCS
    - CCS with "Acceleration Step"
    - Powell's Method
    - Hook-Jeeves
    - GPS
    - Nelder-Mead Simplex
    - Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing
    - Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing with Replacement
    - Hill Climbing with Restarts
    - Simulated Annealing
    - Tabu Search
    - ILS
    - ABC
    - PSO
    - BFO
    - GWO
    - ACO
    - WOA

8. **Other Notes**:  
    - Use `test.py` if you wish to test your bot outside of the leaderboard functionality.

9. **Possible Hyperparameters**:  
    - `N_short`: Short MA window  
    - `N_long`: Long MA window  
    - `filter_type_short`: Type of filter for short MA (e.g., 0 = SMA, 1 = EMA, 2 = LMA)  
    - `filter_type_long`: Type of filter for long MA  
    - `alpha_short`: EMA decay for short MA (if used)  
    - `alpha_long`: EMA decay for long MA (if used)  
    - `threshold`: Optional crossover margin  
    - `smooth_window`: Optional signal smoothing  
    - `rebuy_delay`: Delay between trades  
    - `hold_threshold`: Minimum price drop to trigger a sell
