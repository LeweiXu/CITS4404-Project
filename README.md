# CITS4404-Project

## A Trading Bot Optimization Algorithm

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/btcinusd

After a nice conversation with Gupta I realized many of y'all may not have a coding background, so I have tried to abstract this project as much as possible. Of course, if someone could check over my code that would be great.

I have tried to include documentation for each function, however I will run things over here:
- The ultimate goal of this project is to optimize hyperparameters using an algorithm. The number of hyperparameters may vary depending on what type of filters you use (maybe the type of filter itself is a hyperpamater).
- Datasets are contained in the folder data/, you can choose which dataset to use. I have separated the daily and hourly datasets to before 2020 and after 2020. Please use the datasets for before 2020 as the project specifies.

Static? functions (shouldn't need changing unless there is a logic problem)
- I have written a function in utils.data_loader to read the csv files. It takes a couple of arguments to change how you may want to read the csv files, do look at the documentation.
- The function simulate_trades() in bots.trader simulates the trades based based on the signals generated by your optimization algorithm. AKA it evaluates the **fitness** of your algorithm
- I have defined the basic filters in filters.wma. Do look at the documentation.

Goal:

Other notes:
- Ignore signals.crossover for now iunno what i was doing there, delete it if you want.

Possible hyperparameters:

N_short,        # Short MA window

N_long,         # Long MA window

filter_type_short,  # e.g., 0 = SMA, 1 = EMA, 2 = LMA

filter_type_long,

alpha_short,    # EMA decay (if used)

alpha_long,     # EMA decay (if used)

threshold,      # Optional crossover margin

smooth_window,  # Optional signal smoothing

rebuy_delay,    # Delay between trades

hold_threshold  # Minimum price drop to trigger sell
